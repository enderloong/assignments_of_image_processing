% SEGMENT_PANDA contains the implementation of the main routine for Assignment 2. 
% This routine reads a image, which contains three intensity classes.
% The routine employs the Expectation-maximization method to estimate the parameters
% of the three intensity classes with a mixture of three Gaussian distributions, and
% segment the image with minimum error thresholds.
%  
function segment_image() 

% Define convergence threshold.

% Read the panda image and convert the color image into grayscale image.

% Build a histgoram of the image, it is for the sake of
% parameter estimations and visualization.
